    "cat_luck": "Luck & Effort",
    "cat_wallet": "Wallet & Configuration",
    "rewards_q1": "What is the minimum payout?",
    "rewards_a1": "The minimum payout is <strong>1 ERG</strong>. Once your confirmed balance reaches this threshold, the pool automatically sends your earnings to your wallet address.",
    "rewards_q2": "How often are payments sent?",
    "rewards_a2": "The pool checks balances <strong>every 30 minutes</strong>. If your confirmed balance is above 1 ERG, a payment is triggered automatically.",
    "rewards_q3": "What does \"Unconfirmed balance\" mean?",
    "rewards_a3": "When a block is found, the reward must wait for <strong>720 confirmations</strong> (~24 hours) before it becomes spendable. During this time, your share of the reward appears as \"unconfirmed\" or \"pending\".",
    "rewards_q4": "What is an orphan block?",
    "rewards_a4": "An orphan block is a valid block that was found by the pool but was later removed from the blockchain (another pool found a competing block at the same height). No rewards are distributed for orphan blocks.",
    "rewards_q5": "Are there transaction fees on payouts?",
    "rewards_a5": "The network transaction fee (0.001 ERG per payment) is <strong>paid by the pool</strong>. Nothing is deducted from your balance.",
    "rewards_q6": "I haven't received a payment, what should I do?",
    "rewards_a6": "Check your <strong>confirmed balance</strong> on the Miner page. If it's below 1 ERG, you need to keep mining until the threshold is reached. Also make sure your wallet address is correct and that you are not using an exchange address that has changed.",
    "mining_q1": "What is pool mining?",
    "mining_a1": "Pool mining combines the computing power of multiple miners to find blocks faster. When a block is found, the reward is shared among all contributing miners based on the work they submitted (shares).",
    "mining_q2": "What is the difference between PPLNS and SOLO?",
    "mining_a2": "<strong>PPLNS</strong> (Pay Per Last N Shares) distributes rewards among all miners who contributed recent shares. <strong>SOLO</strong> gives the entire block reward to the miner who found it, but blocks are found much less frequently for a solo miner.",
    "mining_q3": "What are shares?",
    "mining_a3": "A share is a proof of work submitted by your miner that demonstrates your GPU is working. Shares have varying difficulty \u2014 the pool uses them to measure your contribution. A share that meets the network difficulty becomes a block solution.",
    "mining_q4": "What is variable difficulty (vardiff)?",
    "mining_a4": "The pool automatically adjusts the difficulty of shares sent to your miner to maintain a target of about <strong>1 share every 15 seconds</strong>. Faster GPUs get higher difficulty shares, but this does not affect your earnings \u2014 one high-difficulty share is worth the same as multiple lower-difficulty shares.",
    "mining_q5": "If I turn off my rig before a block is found, do I lose my work?",
    "mining_a5": "In PPLNS, only shares within the current window count. If you stop mining, your shares gradually age out of the window. As long as you were mining recently when the block was found, you will receive a reward proportional to your contribution.",
    "hashrate_q1": "How much hashrate do I need to mine ERG?",
    "hashrate_a1": "There is no minimum hashrate. Even a single GPU can mine ERG. However, with lower hashrate, it will take longer to accumulate rewards. A typical modern GPU (RTX 3060+) produces around 100-200 MH/s on Autolykos2.",
    "hashrate_q2": "Why is my hashrate on the pool lower than in my miner?",
    "hashrate_a2": "The pool estimates your hashrate from the shares you submit, which is subject to statistical variance. Over short periods (15 minutes), the pool hashrate can fluctuate significantly. The <strong>1-hour average</strong> is more accurate and should be close to your local hashrate.",
    "hashrate_q3": "What is the network hashrate?",
    "hashrate_a3": "The network hashrate is the total combined computing power of all miners on the ERGO blockchain. A higher network hashrate means more competition and a longer average time between blocks for any given pool.",
    "hashrate_q4": "How is the pool hashrate calculated?",
    "hashrate_a4": "The pool adds up the difficulty of all shares submitted by all miners in a time window (e.g., 15 minutes or 1 hour) and divides by the time. This gives an estimate of the pool's total computing power.",
    "luck_q1": "What is effort (luck)?",
    "luck_a1": "<strong>Effort</strong> measures how much work the pool needed to find a block compared to the statistical expectation. 100% effort = the block was found exactly as expected. Below 100% = lucky (found faster). Above 100% = unlucky (took longer).",
    "luck_q2": "Is it normal to see effort above 200%?",
    "luck_a2": "Yes! Mining is random. Sometimes a block takes twice as long as expected (200%+ effort), and sometimes it's found almost instantly (< 10% effort). Over many blocks, the average effort tends toward 100%.",
    "luck_q3": "How long does it take to find a block?",
    "luck_a3": "It depends on the pool's hashrate relative to the network. The formula is: <strong>Network Hashrate / Pool Hashrate \u00d7 2 minutes</strong> (average block time). With higher pool hashrate, blocks are found more frequently.",
    "wallet_q1": "Which wallet should I use?",
    "wallet_a1": "We recommend <strong>Nautilus Wallet</strong> (browser extension) for desktop or <strong>Ergo Wallet</strong> (mobile app) for phones. Both are free, secure, and give you full control of your funds.",
    "wallet_q2": "Can I use an exchange address?",
    "wallet_a2": "It is <strong>not recommended</strong>. Exchanges may change your deposit address without notice, which means payments could be sent to an address you no longer control. Always use a personal wallet.",
    "wallet_q3": "Which mining software should I use?",
    "wallet_a3": "For NVIDIA GPUs, we recommend <strong>lolMiner</strong>. For AMD GPUs, we recommend <strong>TeamRedMiner</strong>. Both have 100% compatibility with KORVEX and are easy to configure.",
    "wallet_q4": "How do I configure mining on HiveOS?",
    "wallet_a4": "In HiveOS, create a new Flight Sheet with: <strong>Coin:</strong> ERG, <strong>Pool:</strong> korvexpool.com:3416, <strong>Wallet:</strong> your ERG address. Select lolMiner (NVIDIA) or TeamRedMiner (AMD) as the miner."
